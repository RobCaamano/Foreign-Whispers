 being a hooker I mean it's humiliating
6
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,590
 
7
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,870
 and degrading but it only lasts 20
8
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,870
 
9
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,280
 minutes and you do get $100 do you

16
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,869
 
17
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,240

 because I hadn't had a job in a long
140
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,890

341
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,929
 some people think his humor has lost
342
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,929
 
343
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:50,449

345
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:51,800
 have said a few critics that since
346
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,800
 
347
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,740

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,649
 you've become a little bit more bland
350
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,649
 
351
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,479
 yeah it's probably true
352
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,479
 
353
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,879

 someone else's show you know it might
356
00:07:01,869 --> 00:07:04,939
 
357
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,779
 open up a bit more when you when you go
358
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:05,779

 out on your own
360
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,939
 
361
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,099
 one thing Leno plans to tinker with and
362
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:10,099
 
363
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:12,379

364
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:12,379
 
365
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,119
 although politicians from Dan Quayle to
366
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:14,119
 
367
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,860

368
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:15,860
 
369
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:19,279
 already are you a Republican or a
370
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,279
 
371
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,119
 Democrat I'm neither actually I'm
372
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,119

375
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,729
 independent because every time I think
376
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,729
 
377
